		<h4>As he tries his hand at baking, brewing and braising, <br>acclaimed food writer Michael Pollan explores how cooking transforms food and shapes our world.</h4>
	</div>
	<div class="film-img"> <img src="imgs/cooked re.jpg"></div>
	<h4>Storyline</h4>
	<p>Explored through the lenses of the four natural elements - fire, water, air and earth - COOKED is an enlightening and compelling look at the evolution of what food means to us through the history of food preparation and its universal ability to connect us. Highlighting our primal human need to cook, the series urges a return to the kitchen to reclaim our lost traditions and to forge a deeper, more meaningful connection to the ingredients and cooking techniques that we use to nourish ourselves. Written by Netflix</p>

	</div>
	<h4>highlighted health problem</h4>
	<p>Pollan highlights changes in society’s perception of bread from something sacred to something we strive to avoid. Throughout time, additional ingredients have been added to bread, such as yeast, which have caused health concerns and increased negative perceptions of bread. Through the examination of the current bread making process, industrialized bakeries are shown in a negative light and are seen as the root of the cause for the reason people have become sick from breads. Overall, Pollan favors breads with minimal ingredients and additives.</p>
	<p>The main purpose of this series is to encourage viewers to prepare home‐cooked meals, highlighting the benefits to our health and souls. The most relevant information and key takeaways for GFF from the special can be found below.</p>

	<h4>Storyline</h4>
	<p>Impassioned chef Jamie Oliver is determined to take on the high statistics of obesity, heart disease and diabetes in the United States. By talking to people in their communities, Oliver will attempt to show people the incredible rewards of cooking for themselves and the people they love. Oliver invites viewers to take a stand and change the way they eat.</p>

	</div>
	<h4>What is Jamie’s Food Revolution?</h4>
	<p>nitially launched as a US TV show, Jamie’s Food Revolution saw Oliver reforming school lunch programmes to help American society tackle obesity and poor eating habits. While the platform of the Revolution is no longer primarily TV-based, it includes other countries and now aims to reform things beyond just kids’ lunchboxes, its end game remains the same – for our children to live healthier and longer lives. Oliver has been using his celebrity influence to spread this message’s importance, developing a set of issues and skills, launching projects, campaigns and programmes, doing a TED talk…there’s even a Food Revolution Day! But without our combined efforts, the Revolution’s impact will fail to reach its full potential – therefore, it’s important that we are aware of the issues/skills that Oliver has highlighted, and involve ourselves in the cause that Jamie’s Food Revolution champions.</p>
	<p>hether you choose to donate, become one of the 700,000+ revolutionaries, participate in one of the Revolution’s projects or simply teach your child the values they preach, it’s important that you join Jamie’s Food Revolution. While the short-term benefits are not always apparent, the long-term ones are clear. If Oliver himself doesn’t thank you, your child sure will.</p>

	<h4>Storyline</h4>
	<p>Healthy Appetite is an exciting new eight part series about fabulous food.  Each week, two of the country’s top chefs compete to see who can reduce the naughty elements in their decadent and delicious restaurant signature dishes and turn them into the healthy option. In episode one there’s plenty of healthy competition in the kitchen as TV favourite Gary O’Hanlon (Operation Transformation, the Restaurant) takes on Cork’s finest Kate Lawlor (Fenn’s Quay, Oyster Tavern)</p>

	<h4>Every chef’s nightmare</h4>
	<p>In each episode TV presenter and healthy food guru Pamela Flood meets two top chefs in their restaurants where they whip up truly mouth-watering and seductive signature appetisers, main courses or desserts: like Paul Flynn’s luxurious ‘Crab Crème Bruleé’, Aoife Noonan’s divine ‘Assiette of Chocolate and Espresso’ or Michelin starred Derry Clarke’s sumptuous Surf n’ Turf.  The chefs are brave enough to allow their dishes to be deconstructed by esteemed dietitian Aveen Bannon who pulls no punches and tells them exactly how much fat, sugar and fibre is in each dish.  This is every chef’s nightmare.</p>

	<h4>more about</h4>
	<p>Some true crime series draw their allure from a certain sense of removal: a murder in an exotic locale, a felony with members of the billionaire set, a heist featuring bizarre, outrageous targets. But “Rotten,” Netflix’s latest documentary series, picks a decidedly more relatable topic: the very food we consume. While using familiar style and rhythms of bloodier, darker doc counterparts, “Rotten” still manages to use the immediacy of the dinner table as a way to help reshape the conversation about what we put in our bodies.</p>
  <p>In a world where huge global supply-chains are increasingly intertwined and consolidated, this series starts on your dinner plate... and follows the money to the shocking consequences--intended or not--of regulation, innovation and greed.</p>
