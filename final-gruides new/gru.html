	  <h3>Dried Fruits</h3>
      <p><details>Processed dried fruit found on supermarket shelves is loaded with sugar which, if not burnt off throughout the day, is converted to fat.A healthy diet should only include 1-2 serves of fruit per day, so munching on a bag of sugary dried fruit isn’t the best idea, especially if you are trying to lose weight.Because much of the sugar content from dried fruit is fructose, it can increase of risk of heart disease and diabetes. Even worse is dried fruit with added sugar, often referred to as ‘candied’ fruit.Health gurus often tout agave and coconut nectar as a better alternative to traditional sweeteners like sugar and honey.</p>

      <h3>Processed Meats</h3>
      <p><details>It may seem like a convenient and healthy lunch option, but packaged processed meats could be endangering you and your family.The World Health Organisation has listed processed meat as a known carcinogen (meaning ‘cancer-causing’).Processed meat refers to items such as hot dogs, ham, salami and sausages.Effectively, if the meat has been treated in some way – such as salting, curing and smoking – it’s been ‘processed’.And while meat can have health benefits, it’s all about moderation and trying to avoid extremely processed meat food groups as much as possible.</p>

      <h3>Orange Juice</h3>
      <p><details>Orange juice is perhaps the trickiest 'healthy drink'! Oranges are a great source of vitamin C, which aids the immune system, tissue growth and repair.We might also hear this frequently asked question: Is orange juice healthy?Many commercial juices are filled with refined sugar. One serving of regular orange juice contains the equivalent of five teaspoons of table sugar.Not only that, all "juice" fruits are basically liquid sugar, even without additives. It is basically a mixture of sucrose (table sugar), glucose and fructose.Eating as much whole fruit as possible is what provides the most nutrition .</p>

      <h3>Flavoured Milk-Is Chocolate Milk</h3>
      <p><details>While it does contain protein needed for strong bones, at seven teaspoons of sugar per 300 ml serving, a small glass of flavoured milk is both a high sugar and high fat option.If you think that’s bad, the flavoured milks on the market today are often sold at double that size or larger – often in 600 ml and 750 ml varieties.Diabetes QLD has also noted that people who drink flavoured milk have a heightened risk of type-2 diabetes, regardless of their body weightOften advertised as improving energy levels and concentration, energy drinks have spiked in popularity over the years Energy drinks .</p>

      <h3>Soft Drinks.</h3>
      <p><details>There’s no hiding from the most obviously unhealthy beverages – soft drinks.They combine the worse things we have listed above, including high sugar levels, with zero nutritional value.This means all you are getting when sipping down on soft drink is sugar and unnecessary calories.And similar to energy drinks, addiction can be a real issue.Our brain releases the pleasure feeling chemical dopamine when we consume sugar.This can then lead to levels of over consumption, using soft drink to continually trigger more and more dopamine.Tip: If your family really has a thirst for the fizz, use mineral water and natural fruit flavourings to create fun and healthy combinations..</p>

      <h3>Truth About Carbs</h3>
      <p><details>Carbs would have to be one of the most demonised food groups on the planet, with many people believing them to be the main link between eating habits and those un-shiftable kilos Carbohydrates are one of three macronutrients that our body converts into energy (the other two being fat and protein).When our body breaks down carbs, it creates glucose, which is essential for brain function.Without it, we would be left feeling sick and fatigued, potentially leading to accumulative health issues.Carbohydrates are one of three macronutrients that our body converts into energy (the other two being fat and protein).When our body breaks down carbs</p>

      <h3>Consuming Carbs</h3>
      <p><details>Carbs are an essential part of a health-promoting diet.Not only do they keep our energy levels stable, they also prevent binge eating, which often occurs when we’re following a low-carb diet.Low-carb diets can be beneficial for weight loss, however the results are unsustainable in the long term.Instead of dieting, we should be focusing on eating a whole foods diet, with plenty of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins and hearty complex carbs.The ‘palm rule’ can be a helpful guide when serving up your carbohydrates Simply serve the quantity of carbs that would fit into your palm Remember, limiting the amount of simple carbs you consume is beneficial for your health</p>

      <h3>vegetables</h3>
      <p><details>Essential Nutrients in VegetablesVegetables are an important part of a healthy eating pattern and are excellent sources of many nutrients, including potassium, fiber, folate (folic acid) and vitamins A, E and C. These nutrients are vital for overall health and maintenance of body systems:Potassium: This nutrient may help to maintain healthy blood pressure. A few sources of potassium include sweet potatoes, white potatoes, tomato products, and spinach.Fiber: Fiber regulates bowel function, helps reduce blood cholesterol levels and may lower risk of heart disease.Folate (folic acid): The body uses folate to form healthy red blood cellsJust remember you need to be burning.</p>

			<h2><b>HEALTHY Grilled chicken</b></h2> 
			<p>Grilled chicken is great. It's simple, it's easy, it's nutritious and it's versatile. With grilling, you aren't drowning the chicken in oil or fat like you do in some other preparation methods. Whether you go skinless or not is up to you.For a long time, chicken skin was thought to have no nutritional value. It was believed to be nothing more than an empty source of fat and calories. But recent research has shown that most of the fat in chicken skin is good fat—meaning it's unsaturated, so it has benefits such as lowering your risk of heart disease. Still, not all of the fat in chicken skin is good fat, and it does add calories, so if you're trying to go for a super-lean meal, skinless chicken is better. Grill some vegetables alongside your chicken for a very healthy meal.</p>

			<p class="large">“If we choose something healthy first, then this gives us a license to choose something bigger later,” says Martin Reimann, co-author of the study. “If you turn it around and choose something heavier early on, then this license is already expired.”<br>By choosing a larger calorie food early in a meal, people subconsciously chose to make healthier choices with the rest of their food options. Researchers were able to determine this by placing cheesecake in a cafeteria line before and after the main meal on different days.<br>Nearly 70 percent of people who took the cheesecake first went on to choose a healthier main and side dish. They went on to eat about 250 fewer calories throughout the course of the meal.<br>While this research seems to give the dessert some leeway, experts caution against thinking of it as a. <span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey">healthy regular</span> option.</p>

      <h1>Desserts are packed with nutrients.</h1> 
      <p>There’s a reason why your body craves certain delicious desserts. Low carb diets often overlook the fact that carbohydrates are an essential nutrient for the body. While desserts may not be the healthiest form of carbohydrates, the right indulgences can fuel your body and mind. Plus, sweets such as pumpkin pie or dark chocolate contain rich sources of whole foods that provide necessary vitamins, fiber, and antioxidants to your diet.</p> 
      <h1> Desserts make you happier…no, really!</h1>
	  <p>Have you ever taken a bite of your favorite dessert and felt instantly transported to a higher level of happiness? That feeling is real. According to The Nest, foods that have a naturally high percentage of carbohydrates help the brain and body produce chemicals (such as serotonin) that contribute to overall emotional well-being. Indulging in your favorite dessert alters your mind and body in positive ways. Take full advantage of this scientific process by allowing yourself to enjoy your favorite sweet treat without that extra side of guilt. You really are doing something good for your body!.</p>
