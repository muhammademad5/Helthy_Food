			<h2>Low fat African food</h2>
			<h4>High-fiber</h4>
			<p>Traditional African food mainly consists of starches, such as corn, barley, grains, legumes, and fiber-rich fruits and vegetables that improve cholesterol levels in the blood, maintain weight, and prevent constipation. Studies also show that dietary fiber plays a role In the prevention of colon cancer, and reduce the incidence of diabetes.</p>
			<h4>Low sodium</h4>
			<p>Traditional African foods depend on the natural flavors of their ingredients rather than table salt, which leads to high blood pressure.</p>
			<h4>Low-fat</h4>
			<p>African diet relies on carbohydrates, fruits and vegetables that do not contain fat, and Africans are not fined for excessive eating of meat, and rely on cooking their food with steam, or by walking on charcoal, which reduces the level of fat significantly.</p>
			<h4>Naturally</h4>
			<p>Africans keep a portion of the seeds of the crop, for planting in the following season, so no GM seeds are used, and fertilizers and pesticides are used in the minimal limits, for the sake of health.</p>
			<h4>Diversified in</h4>
			<p>the African diet, it guarantees the provision of all minerals and vitamins necessary for a healthy body.</p>

			<h2>healthy Asain food</h2>
			<h4>why asain food healthy</h4>
			<p>Food – the remedy to all illnesses. Chances are, you would have heard those words when you were feeling under the weather. One of the unique things about the Asian culture is that the approach to food and eating is to create wellness. 

Whether Indian, Malay or Chinese, some parts of Asian cuisine are renowned for its nutritious and balanced properties.

In fact, researchers at the International Food Policy Research Institute also believe that the Asian plant-based diet1 – locally grown staple grains like rice, starchy roots such as potatoes, legumes, beans and other vegetables and fruits provide the protection against many chronic diseases.

Here are a few healthy Asian food habits you can practice today:</p>
			<p>Have Soup Often – Most soups cooked at home are made from the bones of chicken, beef or fish together with a combination of different vegetables, whether leafy like the spinach, or hardy like the lotus root. The combination of vegetable and broth provides you with a concentrated load of vitamins and minerals with every spoon, which means even a small portion can fill you up quickly. Asian soups are believed to have specific healing properties depending on its ingredients. Not only does it give comfort during times of illnesses like flu, fever or sore throat, it also strengthens the body from fatigue. Just like a hot cup of tea, the warm temperature of soups is also believed to improve the overall digestive process.

			<h2>Healthy USA food</h2>
			<h4>USA food</h4>
			<p>Our communities are drowning in a swamp of unhealthy junk food and beverages, leading to an epidemic of diabetes, obesity, heart disease and tooth decay. Added sugars in our food and drinks are a major threat to public health. And healthy food can be expensive and hard to find in many places.

Healthy Food America is on the frontlines of the fight to ensure that all people have access to healthy, nutritious food and are less exposed to unhealthy junk foods.

We support community leaders across the nation who are advocating for policies and strategies like soda taxes and healthy food incentives to make healthy eating easier for all Americans.

We share the latest research and cutting edge policy and advocacy strategies so advocates can act on the best information and science to drive change in policy, food environments and industry practices.</p>
			<p>Healthy food pricing incentives have emerged as a promising strategy to improve nutrition. We define a healthy food pricing incentive as a monetary award that reduces the price of healthy foods, making them more affordable.

This report updates what is known about incentives and their effectiveness. It describes the design features of incentive programs (e.g. incentive amount, how to provide it, where it can be used) and explores what features may be associated with significant impacts on healthy food consumption and purchases.

			<h2>healthy Canadian food</h2>
			<h4>Canadian food</h4>
			<p>Three years ago, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau outlined his priorities for his new health minister. They included some big ideas to promote public health through healthy eating. They were, and are, urgent. Diet-related chronic disease is the leading cause of death in Canada, costing an estimated $13.8 billion/year. (Source(link is external))

This is where Canada’s Healthy Eating Strategy comes into play with a number of important action areas. Trans fat regulations have been announced. And we see the new Canada Food Guide(link is external) as an important step in the right direction, but we’re still waiting for the two pillars that have been held up by food industry push back:</p>
			<p>Canadians need strong federal leadership to stand up for the real public interest: healthy people, healthy communities and healthy local economies. Consumers making better food choices will help support a necessary transition to a food system that is healthier, more sustainable, and more just. We need government to firmly act in the public interest and implement some bold new ideas.

As we wait for the promised Food Policy for Canada, the government must decide if it will implement some Big Ideas in the public interest, or if it will allow Big Food to hold the rest of us back. Let’s send some strong messages that we need a Healthy Eating Strategy firmly in the public interest..</p>

			<p>First, you need to know that quinoa is not a main course, you’re meant to eat it as a side dish. There is white, red and black quinoa and the taste is more or less the same for all three. You should always wash quinoa first, then cook it al dente in 15 to 20 minutes. Use a fine-meshed strainer to drain. In the morning, quinoa is delicious as a substitute for porridge or bread. For lunch, for example, you can use it for a salad with beetroot, apple and goat cheese. You can serve delicious quinoa muffins with your coffee or tea and in the evening a spoon of quinoa is a healthy addition to any meal. But don’t eat too much of it. At EatWright we don’t have more than 50 grams of cooked quinoa per person.</p>
			<p>Quinoa is praised for being super healthy. It contains more protein than all known grains. It is low in starch but does contain carbohydrates. And we do need carbohydrates as it is good for the functioning of the thyroid gland. It is also high in fibre and therefore more nutritious than bread, for example. It is not genetically modified and always organic. Moreover, it is one of the few plant-based foods that contains all essential 9 amino acids. Amino acids are the building blocks of our body and can be compared with Lego bricks which are used to help your body with various processes such as building muscle and regulating immune function. Our body does not produce these 9 amino acids in order to make the other 12 so we need to get them from the foods we eat.</p>

			<h4>mexicain food</h4>
			<p>We just got back from Mexico a few days ago and it usually takes me much longer to write my recap posts. But I couldn't wait to dive into this one because we honestly had so much amazing food!

I didn't know what to expect when we got to Mexico City – aside from great Mexican food – but I was really happy to find that healthy eating in Mexico City is actually super easy. There are amazing restaurants, a really special food scene and the city is even home two of the top 20 restaurants in the entire world!

I'll share a little bit about the areas we visited and what we did and then we'll dive into the food!</p>
			<p>Overall, Mexico City is a safe city, but we decided to stay in and around the more “upscale” neighborhoods. We stayed in Hipódromo and ventured between Roma, La Condesa, and Polanco. We stayed in a small boutique hotel called Casa Mali by Dominion and it was perfect. It's actually made up of mini apartments which we loved – we had laundry, a kitchenette and plenty of space to spread out.

I would definitely recommend staying in either Roma or La Condesa. They have a little more character than Polanco (it's kind of like the Beverly Hills of Mexico City), are surrounded by great restaurants and tons of parks. Mexico City has SO much green space!</p>

			<p>The Australian Guide to Health Eating is the national Australian food selection guide. The guide is consistent with the 2013 Australian Dietary Guidelines and visually represents the recommended proportion for consumption from each of the five food groups each day. Following a dietary pattern in these recommended proportions will provide enough of the nutrients essential for good health</p>
			<p>Some foods and drinks do not appear in the table above. The 2013 Australian Dietary Guidelines refers to them as ‘Discretionary’. Discretionary choices are called that because they are not an essential or necessary part of healthy dietary patterns. Discretionary foods are high in kilojoules, saturated fat, added sugars, added salt, or alcohol. If chosen, they should be eaten only sometimes and in small amounts.</p>
